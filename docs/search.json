    "text": "1 Julia ecosystem\nWikipedia citation:\n\nJulia is a high-level, general-purpose dynamic programming language, still designed to be fast and productive, for e.g. data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, modeling and simulation, most commonly used for numerical analysis and computational science.\n\n\nThe work on Julia began in 2009 when Jeff Bezanson, Stefan Karpinski, Alan Edelman and Viral B. Shah set out to create a free language that was both high-level and fast. The first public appearance is in 2012. Julia’s syntax is now considered stable, since version 1.0 in 2018.\nJulia can be easily downloaded and installed. See the download page where we can find the following.\n\nMac / LinuxWindows\n\n\nInstall the latest Julia version by running this in your terminal:\ncurl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh\n\n\nInstall the latest Julia version from the Microsoft Store by running this in the command prompt:\nwinget install julia -s msstore\n\n\n\nOn the Julia official webpage one can find the following summary of Julia ecosystem.\n\nVisualizationGeneralData ScienceMLScientific DomainsParallel\n\n\n\n\n1.0.1 Data Visualization and Plotting\nData visualization has a complicated history. Plotting software makes trade-offs between features and simplicity, speed and beauty, and a static and dynamic interface. Some packages make a display and never change it, while others make updates in real-time.\nPlots.jl is a visualization interface and toolset. It provides a common API across various backends, like GR.jl, PyPlot.jl, and PlotlyJS.jl. Makie.jl is a sophisticated package for complex graphics and animations. Users who are used to “grammar of graphics” plotting APIs should take a look at Gadfly.jl. VegaLite.jl provides the Vega-Lite grammar of interactive graphics interface as a Julia package. For those who do not wish to leave the comfort of the terminal, there is also UnicodePlots.jl.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.0.2 Build, Deploy or Embed Your Code\nJulia makes it possible to build complete applications. Write web UIs with Dash.jl and Genie.jl or native UIs with Gtk4.jl. Pull data from a variety of databases. Build shared libraries and executables with PackageCompiler. Deploy on a webserver with HTTP.jl or embedded devices. Powerful shell integration make it easy to managing other processes.\nJulia has foreign function interfaces for C, Fortran, C++, Python, R, Java, Mathematica, Matlab, and many other languages. Julia can also be embedded in other programs through its embedding API. Julia’s PackageCompiler makes it possible to build binaries from Julia programs that can be integrated into larger projects. Python programs can call Julia using juliacall. R programs can do the same with R’s JuliaCall, which is demonstrated by calling MixedModels.jl from R. Mathematica supports calling Julia through its External Evaluation System.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.0.3 Interact with your Data\nThe Julia data ecosystem provides DataFrames.jl to work with datasets, and perform common data manipulations. CSV.jl is a fast multi-threaded package to read CSV files and integration with the Arrow ecosystem is in the works with Arrow.jl. Online computations on streaming data can be performed with OnlineStats.jl. The Queryverse provides query, file IO and visualization functionality. In addition to working with tabular data, the JuliaGraphs packages make it easy to work with combinatorial data.\nJulia can work with almost all databases using JDBC.jl and ODBC.jl drivers. In addition, it also integrates with the Spark ecosystem through Spark.jl.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.0.4 Scalable Machine Learning\nThe MLJ.jl package provides a unified interface to common machine learning algorithms, which include generalized linear models, decision trees, and clustering. Flux.jl and Lux.jl are powerful packages for Deep Learning. Packages such as Metalhead.jl, ObjectDetector.jl, and TextAnalysis.jl provide ready to use pre-trained models for common tasks. AlphaZero.jl provides a high performance implementation of the reinforcement learning algorithms from AlphaZero. Turing.jl is a best in class package for probabilistic programming.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.0.5 Rich Ecosystem for Scientific Computing\nJulia is designed from the ground up to be very good at numerical and scientific computing. This can be seen in the abundance of scientific tooling written in Julia, such as the state-of-the-art differential equations ecosystem (DifferentialEquations.jl), optimization tools (JuMP.jl and Optim.jl), iterative linear solvers (IterativeSolvers.jl), Fast Fourier transforms (AbstractFFTs.jl), and much more. General purpose simulation frameworks are available for Scientific Machine Learning, Quantum computing and much more.\nJulia also offers a number of domain-specific ecosystems, such as in biology (BioJulia), operations research (JuMP Dev), image processing (JuliaImages), quantum physics (QuantumBFS), nonlinear dynamics (JuliaDynamics), quantitative economics (QuantEcon), astronomy (JuliaAstro) and ecology (EcoJulia). With a set of highly enthusiastic developers and maintainers, the scientific ecosystem in Julia continues to grow rapidly.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.0.6 Parallel and Heterogeneous Computing\nJulia is designed for parallelism, and provides built-in primitives for parallel computing at every level: instruction level parallelism, multi-threading, GPU computing, and distributed computing. The Celeste.jl project achieved 1.5 PetaFLOP/s on the Cori supercomputer at NERSC using 650,000 cores.\nThe Julia compiler can also generate native code for GPUs. Packages such as DistributedArrays.jl and Dagger.jl provide higher levels of abstraction for parallelism. Distributed Linear Algebra is provided by packages like Elemental.jl and TSVD.jl. MPI style parallelism is also available through MPI.jl.\n\n\n\n\nJulia is a modern language and comes with cloud computing and more, see JuliaHub webpage and the JuliaHub help page.\n\nThe Modern Platform for Technical Computing. A single place for modeling, simulation, and user built applications with the Julia language. Designed with access to CPUs and GPUs for multi-threading, parallel and distributed computing, JuliaHub’s supercomputing infrastructure allows teams to model breakthrough science and technology.\n\nThe Julia programming language has its own conference, see the JuliaCon 2024.\n\nWelcome to JuliaCon 2024, the premier annual conference for the Julia programming language community! This exciting event brings together developers, researchers, and enthusiasts from around the globe to celebrate and explore the power and versatility of Julia."

    "section": "6 Exercise",
    "text": "6 Exercise\n\n6.1 Context: Least Squares Regression Line\nWe propose a first exercise about simple linear regression. The data are excerpted from this example and saved into data.csv. We propose an ordinary least squares formulation which is a type of linear least squares method for choosing the unknown parameters in a linear regression model by the principle of least squares: minimizing the sum of the squares of the differences between the observed dependent variable (values of the variable being observed) in the input dataset and the output of the (linear) function of the independent variable.\n\nGiven a set of m data points y_{1}, y_{2}, \\dots, y_{m}, consisting of experimentally measured values taken at m values x_{1}, x_{2}, \\dots, x_{m} of an independent variable (x_i may be scalar or vector quantities), and given a model function y=f(x,\\beta), with \\beta =(\\beta_{1},\\beta_{2},\\dots ,\\beta_{n}), it is desired to find the parameters \\beta_j such that the model function “best” fits the data. In linear least squares, linearity is meant to be with respect to parameters \\beta_j, so \n  f(x, \\beta) = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\beta_j\\, \\varphi_j(x).\n In general, the functions \\varphi_j may be nonlinear. However, we consider linear regression, that is \n  f(x, \\beta) = \\beta_1 + \\beta_2 x.\n Ideally, the model function fits the data exactly, so \n  y_i = f(x_i, \\beta)\n for all i=1, 2, \\dots, m. This is usually not possible in practice, as there are more data points than there are parameters to be determined. The approach chosen then is to find the minimal possible value of the sum of squares of the residuals \n  r_i(\\beta) = y_i - f(x_i, \\beta), \\quad i=1, 2, \\dots, m\n so to minimize the function \n  S(\\beta) = \\sum_{i=1}^m r_i^2(\\beta).\n In the linear least squares case, the residuals are of the form \n  r(\\beta) = y - X\\, \\beta\n with y = (y_i)_{1\\le i\\le m} \\in \\mathbb{R}^m and X = (X_{ij})_{1\\le i\\le m, 1\\le j\\le n} \\in \\mathrm{M}_{mn}(\\mathbb{R}), where X_{ij} = \\varphi_j(x_i). Since we consider linear regression, the i-th row of the matrix X is given by \n  X_{i[:]} = [1 \\quad x_i].\n The objective function may be written \n  S(\\beta) = {\\Vert y - X\\, \\beta \\Vert}^2\n where the norm is the usual 2-norm. The solution to the linear least squares problem \n  \\underset{\\beta \\in \\mathbb{R}^n}{\\mathrm{minimize}}\\, {\\Vert y - X\\, \\beta \\Vert}^2\n is computed by solving the normal equation \n  X^\\top X = X^\\top y,\n where X^\\top denotes the transpose of X.\n\n\n6.2 Questions\nTo answer the questions you need to import the following packages.\n\nusing DataFrames\nusing CSV\nusing Plots\n\n\nUsing the packages DataFrames.jl and CSV.jl, load the dataset from data/lecture1/data.csv and save the result into a variable named dataset.\n\n\n\nShow the answer\ndataset = DataFrame(CSV.File(\"data/lecture1/data.csv\"))\n\n\n5×2 DataFrame\n\n\n\nRow\nTime\nMass\n\n\n\nInt64\nInt64\n\n\n\n\n1\n5\n40\n\n\n2\n7\n120\n\n\n3\n12\n180\n\n\n4\n16\n210\n\n\n5\n20\n240\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDo not hesitate to visit the documentation of CSV.jl and DataFrames.jl.\n\n\n\nUsing the package Plot.jl, plot the data.\n\n\n\nShow the answer\nplt = plot(\n  dataset.Time, \n  dataset.Mass,\n  seriestype=:scatter, \n  legend=false, \n  xlabel=\"Time\", \n  ylabel=\"Mass\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate the matrix X, the vector \\beta and solve the normal equation with the operator Base.\\.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse ones(m) to generate a vector of 1 of length m.\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the answer\nm = length(dataset.Time)\nX = [ones(m) dataset.Time]\ny = dataset.Mass\nβ = X\\y\n\n\n2-element Vector{Float64}:\n 11.506493506493449\n 12.207792207792208\n\n\n\nPlot the linear model on the same plot as the data.
